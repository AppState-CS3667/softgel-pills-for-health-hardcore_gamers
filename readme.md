# SoftGelPills Project
Project Description: Based on the requests from the executives, it sounds like we should write three classes: GelCap, AcheAway, and Dreamly. We can
	abstract all generic pill data into the GelCap class and have the others inherit from it. In the constructor, set the basic fields
	and then run the manufacturing process, which we should separate into its own method. We should also make a demo class and unit
	tests for every file. Put the demo class in a separate package, but not with the unit tests.For your first assignment, 
	we would like you to create two types of pills: our pain reliever pill, AcheAway, and our insomnia-fighting pill, 
	Dreamly. Each pill should have a name, strength in mg, size in mm, color, casing material, aqueous solution, and active ingredient. 
	We manufacture the pills by first creating a casing, then injecting an aqueous solution and active ingredient into the casing.
